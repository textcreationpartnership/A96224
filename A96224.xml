         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Secondly, That you would vouchſafe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to take it into your more ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, how you may moſt ſpeedily ſet up CHRIST more gloriouſly in all his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances within this Kingdome, and reforme all things amiſſe throughout the Land, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God is more ſpecially and more immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſhonoured: Among which we humbly lay before you theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:155376:3"/> 1. That the bruitiſh ignorance and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable darkneſſe poſſeſſing the greateſt part of the people in all places of the Kingdome, whereby they are utterly unfit to waite upon God in any holy duty (to the great diſhonour of the Goſpell, and the everlaſting endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering of their poore ſoules) may be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, by a ſpeedy and ſtrict charge to all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters conſtantly to Catechiſe all the youth, and ignorant people, (they being commanded to be ſubject to it) and all ſorts to be preſent at it, and information to be given of all perſons who ſhall withſtand or neglect it.</p>

That the grievous and hainous pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Lords Supper, by thoſe that are groſly ignorant, and notoriouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, may be henceforth with all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian care and due circumſpection prevented.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the bold venting of corrupt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, directly contrary to the ſacred Law of God, and religious humiliation for ſin, which open a wide doore to all Libertiniſme and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to God and man, may be ſpeedily ſuppreſſed every where, and that in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as may give hope that the Church may be no more infected with them.</p>
            <p n="4">

That the Prophanation of any part of the Lords Day, and the dayes of ſolemne Faſting, by buying, ſelling, working, ſporting, travelling or neglecting of Gods Ordinances, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied by appointing ſpeciall Officers in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very place for the due execution of all good Lawes and Ordinances againſt the ſame.</p>

            <p n="6">6. That the Lawes may be quickned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Swearing and Drunkenneſſe, with which the Land is filled and defiled, and under which it mourneth.</p>

            <p n="8">8. That all monuments of Idolatry and Superſtition, but more eſpecially the whole body and practiſe of Popery may be totally aboliſhed.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That Iuſtice may be executed on all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents, according to your ſolemne and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Vow and Proteſtation to that purpoſe.</p>

            <p>That ſo God, who is now by the Sword aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the quarrell of his Covenant, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding your integrity and zeale, may turne from the fierceneſſe of his wrath, heare our prayers, goe forth with our Armies, perfect the worke of Reformation, forgive our ſins, and ſettle Truth and Peace throughout the Kingdome.</p>
